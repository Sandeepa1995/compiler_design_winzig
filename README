Part 1 of the compiler for the Compiler Design Module.

The instructions stated have been followed, however please note that,
1. The C++ used follows the c++11.
2. The .tar also contains the winzing_test_programs
3. The .tree files originally contain an underscore before the number. This is opposed to the command mentioned in the project description.
